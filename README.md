## 🧠 Inspiration & Purpose
This portfolio is more than a resume, it's a digital reflection of my story. I built it to share not only what I've done but who I am: a curious creator, an empathetic engineer, and someone who believes tech should be used to elevate people. Inspired by my uncle's story and driven by the mission to build inclusive technology, I aim to create work that leaves a mark.
